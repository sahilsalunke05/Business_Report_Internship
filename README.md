# Business_Report_Internship


~ Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior, sales data, and marketing campaign responses using Machine Learning models. The goal is to gain insights, segment customers, and build predictive models that can help in business decision-making.

~ Dataset
Name: Combined Customer Sales and Marketing Data

Source: Generated using OpenAI’s ChatGPT (simulated dataset)

Details: Contains demographic information, purchase history, and campaign responses for various customers.

~ Machine Learning Models Used
Random Forest Classifier – to predict if a customer is likely to make a purchase.

Linear Regression – to estimate the amount a customer might spend.

KMeans Clustering – to segment customers into behavioral groups.

~ Key Insights
Income and product interest strongly influence purchase behavior.

Customers are segmented into clusters showing unique spending patterns.

Regression and classification models performed well in prediction tasks.

Some marketing campaigns are less effective and need better targeting.

~ Tools & Libraries
Pandas, NumPy – for data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – for preprocessing and ML models

StandardScaler, KMeans, RandomForestClassifier, LinearRegression
